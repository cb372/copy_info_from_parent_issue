A Redmine plugin that makes it easier to create child tickets.

When you create a new child ticket, it will copy certain field values from the parent ticket, unless you specify a value yourself.

The following fields can be copied:

* Start date
* Due date

You can enable/disable copying of each field on the plugin settings page.

Tested with Redmine 2.2.2.
